No! The cat shelter's on to me. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!

I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. **Ah, yes!** _John Quincy Adding Machine._ He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.

## Soothe us with sweet lies.

You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? I'm Santa Claus! You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!

1. We don't have a brig.
2. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.
3. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.

### You know, I was God once.

Soon enough. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.

- Ummm…to eBay?
- I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.
- What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.

How much did you make me? That's not soon enough! I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?

I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Actually, that's still true. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. I wish! It's a nickel. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.

No! The cat shelter's on to me. When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Hello, little man. I will destroy you!

I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!

I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!

Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

Daylight and everything. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid.

I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Belligerent and numerous. Do a flip! I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things.

And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.

Tell them I hate them. Now what? Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.

This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Hey, guess what you're accessories to. I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!
