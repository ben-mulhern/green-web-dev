Ensure that you are not importing more of a module than you need. You might be unknowingly serving your users a bunch of JavaScript code that will never be executed, increasing the data sent over the wire and subsequently the carbon footprint of your website.

# The Lodash Example

Take for example the popular utility library [lodash](https://lodash.com/), which provides a collection of useful functions for working with JavaScript. Many developers would be correct in thinking that an import of the following format would be wasteful because it would import the whole lodash library;

```
import _ from "lodash";
console.log(_.capitalize("hello world"));
```

Where many people go wrong though is in the belief that the following code solves the problem;

```
import { capitalize } from "lodash";
console.log(capitalize("hello world"));
```

In fact, this is not true. Both of the above two imports will result in the entire `lodash` library being imported into your bundle and served to the user. It is possible for bundlers such as webpack to use [tree-shaking to throw away dead code](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/optimization/), however this feature is normally turned off by default (the reason being that the module may have side-effects that run on import, so it's not safe just to chuck that code away without asking).

So what is the solution? In the case of lodash, you can reduce your bundle size by either only importing from the **category** you are using;

```
import { capitalize } from "lodash/string";
```

Or importing just the particular function you are using for an even smaller import;

```
import capitalize from "lodash/capitalize";
```

## The Solution

Whilst the above example is entirely lodash-specific, the principle holds true for all imports. Unfortunately there is no "one size fits all" strategy for dealing with this as it depends on how the module you are importing has been implemented - what you _can_ do though is ensure that you are no longer assuming what does/doesn't make things better through the use of tools.

One such tool is the [Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost) Visual Studio extension by Wix. For every import you make in your code, it will add in a pseudo-comment telling you how big that import is. This means you will never make assumptions about what is/isn't an efficient import ever again!
