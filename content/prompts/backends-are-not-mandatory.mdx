Don't simply default to running a backend and databases if you don't need to. There may be alternatives (such as JamStacks or just static HTML) which would provide the functionality you need without the overhead (and carbon cost) of running servers.

## The Problem

All too often, developers will reach straight for popular stacks or familiar stacks for everything;

- LAMP/MAMP (Linux/Mac, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- LYME (Linux, Yaws, Mnesia, Erlang)
- MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node)
- MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node)

These stacks do all have their place and are great conventions, but often times they are used by default without considering alternatives. Popular LAMP-stack library Wordpress, for example, proudly claim that their technology powers [42% of the web](https://wordpress.com/) - now Wordpress is a fine CMS, but how many of those sites are just a couple of static pages and a contact form?

## JAMstack / SSG

JAMStack (Javascript, APIs and Markup) is a modern approach to creating web applications where you handle the layout, functionality and content on the client using JavaScript and [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Any functionality that cannot be handled on the client (such as sending emails) is handled using APIs, be they either online services or APIs you write yourself.

On the database front - often times people will spin up databases because they believe that is the only option for storing data... but you might be able to get away with a simple JSON file containing the whole database. This could then be cached locally (depending how big it is) and hey presto - all data access is happening locally and no data is being sent over the wire.

The advantage of all this is that you don't have a server running around the clock waiting for requests that may never come. Popular JAMStack frameworks include [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
