Always use the most appropriate semantic markup and avoid superflous DOM elements. Having an overly-busy DOM will affect [runtime performance and page speed](https://web.dev/dom-size/), as well as contributing to more data being sent to clients. Your browser will also have to work harder when querying and manipulating a busy DOM, leading to additional battery drain.
