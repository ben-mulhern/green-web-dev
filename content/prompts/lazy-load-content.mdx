If possible, you should try to avoid loading content before the user can actually see it. Content might be hidden behind a component or be several pages-worth of scrolling below the bottom of the viewport.

## Common Solutions

- Pagination is a simple way to avoid loading hundreds if items on a single page.
- Infinite Scroll is a popular solution, however be wary of the accessibility pitfalls associated with implementing this kind of solution.
