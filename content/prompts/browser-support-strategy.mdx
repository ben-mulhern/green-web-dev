Choose a browser support strategy that is sustainable.

## Older browsers lack support for sustainable techniques

Many of the gains to be made in terms of sustainabilty in web development come from leveraging the features of modern browsers. Things like [modern image format support](https://caniuse.com/webp), [tags to help serve images at appropriate sizes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) and [CSS media Queries](https://caniuse.com/css-mediaqueries).

By supporting older browsers (and let's just call this what it is - Internet Exporer 11, Opera Mini and any browser-version prior to 2018) you are helping to keep unsustainable web pratcices alive.

Now - obviously it might be that there are commercial reasons that you can't just "stop" supporting these browsers - you may be staring down marketing metrics that suggest you will lose customers (and subsequently revenue) if you cut off support for older browsers. It's also important to consider inclusivity in our applications - unfortunately that sometimes means catering for people who are perhaps not very computer litirate and for whom "upgrading their browser" is quite a scary step to take.

All that said - you are not doing your customers any favours by helping them continue to use outdated browsers, especially Internet Explorer, for which Microsoft have officially [withdrawn support](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/05/19/the-future-of-internet-explorer-on-windows-10-is-in-microsoft-edge/)). Continuing to use older browsers therefore represents a very real security risk.

You have a few options;

- Simply refuse to serve customers using older browsers.
- Continue to cater for these users, but encourage them to upgrade their browser. There are [tools out there](https://browser-update.org/) to help you do this.

## Don't force users to use a particular browser

So often in industry we see company websites that advise users to use a particular brand of browser for "the best experience". In some instances, this comes from a good place: encouraging customers to upgrade and use the most modern browsers. Tooling and algorithms are always striving to be more efficient so modern tooling usually means a longer battery life and a better user experience.

In other cases though, developers will instead force users down the path of using a particular browser purely so they don't have to support the others. Wihlst this might lead to an increase in productivity, you need to weight this against the fact that you may be forcing users to use browsers that are more memory hungry (and power hungry) than their lighter alternatives. Chrome, for example, is an excellent browser but is frequently [called out as being very memory hungry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/chrome-using-much-ram-fix-right-now/). By forcing your customers to use a particular browser, you may also be forcing them to use more of their laptop batteries.
