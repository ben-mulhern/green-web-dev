Defer the loading of images until they are within the active viewport. This avoids paying the data cost for images the user never sees.

Lazy image loading used to be fiddly to implement, requiring an understanding of JavaScript. However, it is now **natively supported** across [all major browsers](https://caniuse.com/loading-lazy-attr) and requires no programming knowledge. Simply assign the `"lazy"` property to the `loading` attribute of the `img` tag, e.g.

```
<img loading="lazy" src="/foobar.jpg" alt="bar baz" />
```

This change ensures the request for `foobar.jpg` is only sent if the user scrolls to the image's location. This technique is supported by screen readers, and works within `iframe` tags.

Since this technique will degrade gracefully into older browsers, there is little reason to not use it.
