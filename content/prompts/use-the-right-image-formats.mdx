Always try to use the most appropriate image file format for the type of image you are working with. Photographic images work very well with lossy formats such as JPEG, whereas for something like a logo where you may want to draw it at different sizes and in different colors, SVG format may be more appropriate.

Here's a quick table listing some recommendations - note that both WebP and AFIV are versatile enough to cover multiple formats and normally offer 20-30% better compression than alternatives. Where possible, you should always try to use vector graphics.

| Image Type   | Preferred Format | Fallback Format |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Photography  | WebP, AVIF       | JPEG            |
| Flow Diagram | SVG              | WebP, AVIF,PNG  |
| Animation    | WebP, AVIF       | GIF             |
| Transparency | WebP, AVIF       | PNG, GIF        |
| Logo         | SVG              | WebP, AVIF, PNG |
| Icon         | SVG              | WebP, AVIF, PNG |

Choosing the wrong image format can result in your image files being _much larger_ than they need to be (sometimes hundreds of times bigger).

Be cautious using the AVIF format currently - whilst it is designed as a successor to WebP, tooling and [browser support](https://caniuse.com/avif) have not yet reached a high enough level of maturity so you will definitely want to provide fallback images within your pages (you can do this using the [HTML5 `picture`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) element).
