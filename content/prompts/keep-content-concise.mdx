You should try to front-load your content and keep it concise and to the point. The days of packing a page out with content purely for SEO are over and doing so may in fact [harm your SEO](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide).

As well as being a good way to engage your users, there are a few sustainability angles to front loading too;

- Excessive, waffley content increases your page load times and data over the wire.
- Users may need to spend longer on your site than they have to, picking through the fluffy writing to get to the thing they are looking for.
