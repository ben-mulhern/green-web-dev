# The Climate Crisis

The **Climate Crisis** currently affecting the planet is the most pressing existential threat that humankind has ever faced. Carbon emissions caused by years of post industrial human activity is causing Earth's temperature to rise, and we are already seeing the effects of this through an increase in extreme weather conditions, flooding and wildfires, as well as irreversable damage to the polar ice caps.

The current scientific consensus estimates that we will begin to see the worst effects of climate change once the Earth's temperature reaches between 1.5&deg;C and 2&deg;C above pre-industrial levels. Soberingly, these effects will include threats to life including increases in malaria, drought and famine. Thesee effects are likely to hit the poorest countries the worst, despite those countries not being the biggest emmitters of carbon.

Efforts are being made globally to reduce carbon emissions - every country in the world has signed the [Paris Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) (a pledge to make sure we never hit that figure of 1.5&deg;). The numbers are heading in the right direction, however the **change is not happening quickly enough** and currently we are on track to reach 1.5&deg; by 2030. The only chance we have of stopping this is for all nations to work together and make drastic changes to their environmental policies, industries and lifestyles.

## But what can web developers do?

Most of the carbon cost that websites and applications put into the atmosphere comes through electricity, so we could just kick back and wait for the world to switch to renewable energy right? Leave it to someone else to sort out and just carry on doing things the way we currently are?

Well, No. Not exactly. Firstly, we're not there yet in terms of having 100% renewable energy, so anything we can do to slow the consumption of fossil fuels is a positive thing. Secondly, there are other costs such as increased e-waste that our applications may be indirectly (or directly) contributing to.

As **web developers** and **digital professionals**, we are in a **unique position** to help reduce the carbon footprint caused by our industry. Typically, much of the blame for carbon emissions is aimed at data centers, but we as developers do share in that responsibility because it is our applications that they are hosting. Because there is a direct correlation between the carbon impact of digital services and the number of users/visitors that those services receive, a single good decison that we make around sustainability can propogate into huge savings on carbon emissions for our applications.

This website aims to bring together **community curated knowledge** and capture simple [prompts](/prompts) that web developers can use to help reduce the carbon footprint of their applications - and the great news is that many of these techniques are simple to implement and usually come with other bonuses, such as faster page load times and cheaper hosting bills (you might even find that you're hitting many sustainability beats already!).

As well as prompts, you will also find [articles](/articles) where we'll take a deeper dive and elaborate upon the more complex topics.

This is **not about making developers feel guilty** for every byte of data they use, nor is it about shaming anyone or telling them what they should or should not be doing in their application - It's simply about making data and CPU usage a **concious** and **managed** part of our software development process - and it may be a lot easier than you think!
