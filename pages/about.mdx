# Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.

Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Then we'll go with that data file! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. A [true inspiration](http://www.google.com) for the children. **Switzerland is small and neutral!** _We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!_ Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!

## Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?

1. Negative, bossy meat creature!
2. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
3. And yet you haven't said [what I told you to say](http://www.google.com)! How can any of us trust you?

### Take me to your leader!

Is that a cooking show? Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

- And I'm his friend Jesus.
- Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!
- We're rescuing ya.

Also Zoidberg. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Anyone who laughs is a communist!

```
console.log("Foobar");
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
```

Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Okay, I like a challenge. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?

Moving along… I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.

With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Kif might! Bender?! You stole the atom. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…

I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Why not indeed! In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Throw her in the brig. She also liked to shut up! Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Take me to your leader! Ow, my spirit! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.

I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Kif might! I never loved you. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.

Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Really?! Can we have Bender Burgers again? Shinier than yours, meatbag. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. No! The cat shelter's on to me. Then we'll go with that data file! Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.
