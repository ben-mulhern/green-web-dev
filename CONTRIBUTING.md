# Contributing

It is our intention that this website be contributable to by the whole of the web developer community. In order to achieve this, we do need to set a few principles and guidelines around contributing (expect these to evolve over time).

## The first rule

Before spending any significant time on any contribution, [raise an issue on our github](https://github.com/mikeyhogarth/green-web-dev/issues).

## Contributing a Prompt

Prompts should be quick, digestible bits of advice that can help reduce the carbon footprint of a web application, generally this will either be through reducing CPU cycles or reducing data usage by a significant amount.

There are a myriad of ways to save data and CPU cycles so any prompts should be fairly wide-reaching/widely applicable and broad. We don't want to end up just listing every single way to make your code more efficient or we'll be here forever!

A prompt **Should** have the following properties;

- It should be completely readable in less than 2 minutes
- The first sentence should be a statement which summarises the entire prompt.
- Where applicable, the prompt should include good examples and bad examples.
- Where applicable, [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/) links should be provided.
- The prompt should end with some useful links for futher reading, allowing the user to continue investigating the topic should they want to.

A prompt **Should Not** have the following properties;

- It should not press a developer to sacrifice code quality or maintainability

## Contributing an Article

For the time being, articles on this site are core-team only, however if you have written an article elsewhere that is pertinant to any of the prompts, you are free to suggest it as a relevant link to that prompt.
